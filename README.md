# PokeOneWeb

PokeOneWeb is an application with content around the MMORPG PokéOne. The game is being developed by fans of the franchise using the game engine Unity, and is currently in the open beta phase. By now, the game already has several thousand active players from all over the world.

A small group of players form the team behind the “Unofficial PokéOne Guide,” who aim to gather and present a wide variety of useful information about the game to players. Currently, the information is stored and continuously updated in a Google Spreadsheet. The users of the guide directly access this spreadsheet in read-only mode, while the team is able to edit the spreadsheet.
